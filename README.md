# :video_game: Pac-Men Factory

## :two_hearts: Description

A very quick demonstration of adding elements to the DOM programmatically on click, with some basic JavaScript animation and edge detection to allow the Pac-Men to float and bounce around the screen.

## :question: How to run

A live version can be viewed at https://helloaimee.github.io/pacmen-factory. 

This project has no special dependencies. Save each file to a folder on your local machine for customization.

## :clock9: Roadmap of future improvements
### To do
- [ ] Change direction the Pac-Man is facing (forgot to do this)
- [ ] Add actual CSS instead of the random colors I slapped on
- [ ] Add map and boundaries
